## Highlights
- Present a Physics-informed discrete learning framework for solving spatiotemporal PDEs without any labeled data
- Proposed an encoder-decoder convolutional-recurrent scheme for low-dimensional feature extraction
- Employ hard-encoding of intial and boundary conditions
- Incorporate autoregressive and residual connections to explicitly simulate the time marching

We demonstrate excellent solution accuracy, extrapolability and generalizability on three nonlinear PDEs as follows.



1. Traing and Extrapolation 

2D Burgers' equaions, $\Lambda$-$\Omega$ reaction diffusion equations, and FitzHuge-Nagumo reaction diffusion eqautions.

2. Generalization

FitzHuge-Nagumo reaction diffusion eqautions
